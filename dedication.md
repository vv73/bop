# Dedication

To [Kalyan Varma](http://www.kalyanvarma.net/) and many other seniors at [PESIT](http://www.pes.edu/) who introduced us to GNU/Linux and the world of open source.

To the memory of [Atul Chitnis](http://www.nextbigwhat.com/atul-chitnis-obituary-297/), a friend and guide who shall be missed greatly.

To the [pioneers who made the Internet happen](http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/index.html). This book was first written in 2003. It still remains popular, thanks to the nature of sharing knowledge on the Internet as envisioned by the pioneers.
